        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Cozy Bean Café was born in 2018 from a simple dream: to create a cozy spot where people could enjoy exceptional coffee and genuine moments. What started as a small family-run café has now grown into a beloved place for friends, students, and coffee lovers alike. 
          Our founders were passionate about crafting the perfect coffee, and with every cup, they aimed to create more than just a drink — but a memorable experience.
